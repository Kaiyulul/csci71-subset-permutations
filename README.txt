Hello! I am Kyle Tandoc. I chose to do #2 to generate possibilities using basic Python. 

---

As far as I know nothing is needed to run the code from the .exe file. You just need to double-click it or right-click then click Open or Run as Administrator. 

But if you need to run it from terminal for technical difficulties, all you need to do is have Python installed and navigate to the folder where the program is placed. (Hopefully in this case, it is in the CSCI71-194892-programmingProject folder that was made from extracting the zip). Then, type:

python sourcecode.py

---

In terms of functionality, prompts will show up when using the program. You will be using numbers as input to select which of the 2 programs to test. 1 for generating Subsets, 2 for generating Permutations. Then, it will loop back asking for input again to either test the program again, change to another, or exit.

I have also put comments in the source code if anything needs explanation. Hope all goes well!
